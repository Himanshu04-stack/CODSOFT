## **✅ Task Descriptions**

### **🎮 Task 1: Number Guessing Game**

A simple yet interactive number guessing game using core Java concepts. The program generates a random number, and the user must guess it with hints.

  * **Features:**
      * Random number generation
      * User input with attempts tracking
      * Game restart on win/loss
  * **Concepts:** `Random`, `Scanner`, loops, conditions

-----

### **📊 Task 2: Student Grade Calculator**

An advanced console-based application that accepts subject-wise marks and computes total, average, and grade using **OOP** principles.

  * **Features:**
      * Add multiple students with subject marks
      * Auto-calculate average and grade
      * Exception handling for input
  * **Concepts:** `Class`, `List`, `Scanner`, **OOP**, methods, modular design

-----

### **🏧 Task 3: ATM Interface (Banking Simulation)**

Simulates basic ATM operations such as checking balance, withdrawing and depositing cash, with user login and PIN authentication.

  * **Features:**
      * Bank account abstraction
      * PIN authentication system
      * Deposit, withdraw, and balance check
      * Error handling and validation
  * **Concepts:** `Interfaces`, `Abstraction`, Custom Exceptions, `Scanner`, **OOP**

-----

### **💱 Task 4: Currency Converter**

A clean, offline currency converter that allows conversion between INR and 5+ global currencies using a **Swing interface** or console mode.

  * **Features:**
      * Convert between **INR, USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, CAD**
      * Validations for input
      * Menu-driven UI
  * **Concepts:** `Maps`, `Classes`, **Java Swing**, `Scanner`, Console app, **OOP**

-----

### **🎓 Task 5: University Student Management System (GUI)**

A **Java Swing GUI** application to manage student records including university-level information like department, course, and contact details.

  * **Features:**
      * Add Student (with Department, Course, Email, Mobile, Address)
      * View All Students in a `JTable`
      * Search/Delete by Roll No
      * Email and Duplicate validation
      * Preloaded 6 student records for demo
  * **Concepts:** **Java Swing**, `JFrame`, `JTable`, Validation, **OOP**, MVC-like separation

-----

## **🔧 Tools & Technologies Used**

  * **Language:** `Java 17+`
  * **IDE:** `IntelliJ IDEA`
  * **Frameworks:** `Java Swing` (for GUI)
  * **Version Control:** `Git` & `GitHub`
  * **Build/Run:** `Terminal` / `IDE`

-----

## **📚 Learning Outcomes**

  * Deep understanding of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles in Java.
  * Real-world application design using **Java Swing** for graphical interfaces.
  * Writing **modular, readable, and validated** Java code.
  * Using **Git** for version control and **GitHub** for collaboration.
  * Designing interactive interfaces and practicing **logic separation**.
